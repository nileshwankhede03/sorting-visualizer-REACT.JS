# Sorting-Visualizer
The Sorting Visualizer is a tool that helps users understand how different sorting algorithms work by visually displaying the sorting process. The array elements are represented as individual boxes containing numbers, and their movements during sorting are highlighted with different colors to show comparisons and swaps.
